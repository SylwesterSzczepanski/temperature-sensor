## Temperature, humidity and pressure sensor which you can access through web site.

I have used few sources and compiled together something that works.
It is ongoing projects which uses ESP 8266 in conjuction with BME280. As a starting point I have followed **[this](http://projects.xief.net/?p=638)** instructions.
I'm aiming for low power solution, which includes ESP deep sleep.
